# this asks the user for a number and turns the answer
# into an integer
n = int(input("How many times should I loop? "))

# Now, print "Hello, World!" n times 
for i in range (n): 
    print("Hello, World!")
#also correct= for i in range (0,n,1): 

#(0,n,1) means go from 0 to n with steps by 1 

#j=0
#while j <n:
#    print("Hello, World!")
#    j+=1
